## Snake-Robot-Simulation: Bringing Agility and Vision to Disaster Response

### Introduction
This project explores the development of a snake robot prototype for potential applications in disaster response. The focus lies on its motion control and image classification capabilities, laying the groundwork for future advancements in autonomous navigation and casualty detection.


### Project Philosophy

This project supports the fusion of robotics and computer vision to create efficient and adaptable solutions for emergency situations. We believe that snake robots, with their inherent flexibility and maneuverability, hold significant potential for navigating disaster-stricken environments and aiding search and rescue efforts.

### Summary
